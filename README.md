# MyTelkomsel Intelligent Search

This project is a semantic product search engine built for the MyTelkomsel ecosystem. It combines traditional fuzzy search with modern LLM-powered semantic search using OpenAI embeddings and ChromaDB, allowing users to query products in natural language and receive relevant product matches ranked by meaning and relevance.
